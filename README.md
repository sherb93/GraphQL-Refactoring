# GraphQL-Refactoring

## Summary
This is a book search engine using the Google Books API. It was originally made using RESTful API routes written with Express.js. I have refactored it to be a GraphQL API with an Apollo Server.

## Description
As new technologies arise and overtake previous ones, refactoring is a common task in the workplace. GraphQL is a newer query language for APIs that is beoming very popular and knowing how to use it has become a priority of mine.

This project allowed me to get a better sense of the file structure and syntax for GraphQL and Apollo. I had to understand the processes happening in Express and translate them into GraphQL.

## Usage
The app is deployed to Heroku using a MongoDB Atlas to house the database.
